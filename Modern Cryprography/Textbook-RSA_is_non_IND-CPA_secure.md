The **IND-CPA (indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attack)** security is a notion of security for encryption schemes, and RSA is a widely used public-key cryptosystem. *Textbook RSA*, which is a raw form of RSA without padding, is not considered IND-CPA secure.

To prove this, we need to show that an adversary can distinguish between the encryptions of two different plaintexts of their choice with non-negligible advantage.

Consider a simple chosen-plaintext attack. Let the RSA public key be `(N, e)`, where `N` is the product of two large primes, `p` and `q`, and `e` is the public exponent. Suppose an adversary `A` selects two distinct plaintexts `m1` and `m2` from the message space `{0, 1, ..., N-1}`. 

Now, `A` asks for the encryption of a random plaintext from `{m1, m2}` under the public key `(N, e)`. Let's assume without loss of generality that the challenger chooses `m1` and returns the ciphertext `c = m1^e mod N`.

The adversary `A` can now choose a random value `r` from the message space `{0, 1, ..., N-1}`, compute `r^e mod N`, and multiply this with the given ciphertext `c`:

c' = c * r^e mod N = (m1^e * r^e) mod N

Now, `A` can decrypt `c'` using the public key:

c'^d mod N = (m1^e * r^e)^d mod N = m1 * r mod N

Since `A` knows `r` and has access to the encryption oracle, it can encrypt `m2 * r mod N`:

c2 = (m2 * r)^e mod N

Now, `A` compares `c'` and `c2`. If they are equal, `A` can conclude that the original plaintext was `m1`; otherwise, it must be `m2`. In either case, `A` has successfully distinguished between the two chosen plaintexts, proving that textbook RSA is not IND-CPA secure.

In summary, the lack of randomization and padding in textbook RSA allows an adversary to exploit the homomorphic properties of RSA, leading to its failure to meet the IND-CPA security notion. To make RSA secure, padding schemes like PKCS#1 or OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding) are used in practice.

The IND-CPA (indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attack) security is a notion of security for encryption schemes, and RSA is a widely used public-key cryptosystem. Textbook RSA, which is a raw form of RSA without padding, is not considered IND-CPA secure.

To prove this, we need to show that an adversary can distinguish between the encryptions of two different plaintexts of their choice with non-negligible advantage.

Now, A asks for the encryption of a random plaintext from {m1, m2} under the public key (N, e). Let's assume without loss of generality that the challenger chooses m1 and returns the ciphertext c = m1^e mod N.

The adversary A can now choose a random value r from the message space {0, 1, ..., N-1}, compute r^e mod N, and multiply this with the given ciphertext c:

c' = c * r^e mod N = (m1^e * r^e) mod N

Now, A can decrypt c' using the public key:

c'^d mod N = (m1^e * r^e)^d mod N = m1 * r mod N

Since A knows r and has access to the encryption oracle, it can encrypt m2 * r mod N:

c2 = (m2 * r)^e mod N

Now, A compares c' and c2. If they are equal, A can conclude that the original plaintext was m1; otherwise, it must be m2. In either case, A has successfully distinguished between the two chosen plaintexts, proving that textbook RSA is not IND-CPA secure.
