# Subjects Learned During the Semester

This repository contains notes and exercises for the following subjects learned during the semester:

1. Complex Analysis
2. Public Key Cryptography
3. Modern Cryptography

## :bar_chart: Complex Analysis

Complex analysis is the study of complex functions, which are functions that have complex numbers as inputs and outputs. This subject is important in many areas of mathematics, physics, and engineering. Topics covered in this course include complex numbers, complex functions, contour integrals, power series, and more.

## :key: Public Key Cryptography

Public key cryptography is a method of cryptography that uses a pair of keys to encrypt and decrypt data. One key is public and can be shared with anyone, while the other key is private and must be kept secret. This subject is important in information security and computer science. Topics covered in this course include RSA encryption, Diffie-Hellman key exchange, digital signatures, and more.

## :lock: Modern Cryptography

Modern cryptography is a broad field that encompasses many different techniques for securing information. This subject is important in information security and computer science. Topics covered in this course include symmetric encryption, hash functions, block ciphers, and more.

## :computer: Usage

This repository contains LaTeX files for each subject, as well as compiled PDF files. The LaTeX files can be edited and compiled using a LaTeX editor, such as TeXstudio or Overleaf. The PDF files can be viewed and printed using a PDF viewer, such as Adobe Acrobat or SumatraPDF.
